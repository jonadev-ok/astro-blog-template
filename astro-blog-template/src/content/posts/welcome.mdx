## Introduction

Welcome to **JD Blog**  
This site was created as a personal and technical space to document learnings, share experiences, and publish content related to modern web development.

JD Blog is not just a blog, it’s also:
- an ideas lab
- a reusable template
- a reference point for content-based projects
