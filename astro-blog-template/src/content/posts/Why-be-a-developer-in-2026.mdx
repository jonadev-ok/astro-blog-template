## Introduction

Every year the same question arises:

> Is it still worthwhile to train as a developer?

In 2026, with the maturity of artificial intelligence, automation, and the saturation of certain profiles, the question is more valid than ever.

The short answer is: **yes**, but not just any way.

This article seeks to explain **why it is still a good idea to train as a developer**, what has changed compared to previous years, and what kind of approach makes sense today.

## Development Didn't Disappear, It Transformed

The narrative that “AI will replace developers” ignores a basic reality:

- Software continues to grow
- Systems are becoming increasingly complex
- Companies need customized solutions

What has changed is **the type of tasks**:

- Less repetitive work
- More emphasis on systems design
- More technical expertise and high-level decision-making

Training as a developer in 2026 means learning to **work with intelligent tools**, not competing against them.

## Demand Still Exists (But It's More Demanding)

It's not true that “there are no more jobs,” but it is true that:

- The market is more competitive
- Generic profiles have a harder time finding work
- Simply knowing how to copy tutorials is no longer enough

Companies are looking for developers who:
- Understand the fundamentals
- Know how to read and maintain code
- Can adapt to new technologies

The good news: **These profiles are still scarce**.

## Learning to program gives you structured thinking

Beyond work, training as a developer develops transferable skills:

- problem-solving
- logical thinking
- systems analysis
- technical communication

Even if you don't end up working as a programmer your whole life, these skills:
- enhance your professional profile
- make you more independent
- allow you to understand the digital world from the inside out

---

## Access to knowledge has never been higher

In 2026 you'll have:
- excellent official documentation
- quality courses
- active communities
- AI-assisted learning tools

It's never been easier to:
- test ideas
- fail fast
- build real projects

The technical barrier to entry has lowered, but the **conceptual barrier** remains key.

---

## Development is a long-term career

Learning to program isn't a sprint, it's an investment.

It's not about:
- learning a trendy framework
- memorizing APIs
- blindly following trends

It's about:
- understanding fundamentals
- developing critical thinking skills
- learning how to learn

In 2026, valuable developers are those who:
- adapt
- know how to say "I don't know, but I'll look into it"
- understand why the code works

---

## Frontend, Backend, and Beyond

Today, development encompasses multiple paths:

- frontend (UX, performance, accessibility)
- backend (data, APIs, architecture)
- tools and platforms
- technical content and documentation
- product and systems

Training as a developer doesn't confine you to a single role.

It opens doors to specializing over time.

---

## AI as an Ally, Not a Threat

In 2026, ignoring AI is a mistake.

Relying on it completely is, too.

A good developer:
- knows how to use AI to accelerate tasks
- understands the code they generate
- can correct and improve results

AI amplifies those with technical expertise.

It doesn't replace those who understand the problem.

--

## For whom does training as a developer make sense today?

Training as a developer in 2026 makes sense if:

- you enjoy solving problems
- you're curious
- you accept that learning is continuous
- you're not looking for immediate results

It's not a magic bullet, but it is one with a **high long-term return**.

--

## Conclusion

Training as a developer in 2026 is still a very good idea, provided that:

- you have realistic expectations
- you prioritize fundamentals over trends
- you build real projects
- you understand that technology evolves

Development isn't just writing code.

It's **thinking, designing, and building solutions**.

And that, today and in the future, remains valuable.

## Next Steps

If you're starting out:
- Learn solid foundations
- Choose a simple stack
- Build real things

If you're already a developer:
- Deepen your understanding of the fundamentals
- Improve your judgment
- Teach what you learn

The journey isn't over. It's just changed shape.
