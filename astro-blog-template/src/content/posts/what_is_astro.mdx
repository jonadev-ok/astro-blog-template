## Introduction

Astro is a **modern framework for building fast websites**, focused on delivering static HTML by default and sending JavaScript only when it's truly necessary.

It's especially suited for:
- blogs
- documentation
- portfolios
- content sites

where **performance, simplicity, and control** are key.

## What is Astro's philosophy?

Astro is based on a simple idea:

> **The best JavaScript is the one that isn't sent.**

Instead of building the entire application as a Single-Page Application (SPA), Astro:
- renders content at build time
- generates static HTML
- allows you to add interactivity as needed

This is known as the **Islands Architecture** model.

---

## Islands Architecture

Island architecture means that:

- The site is static HTML by default
- Interactive components are loaded in isolation
- Each island can use React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, etc.

### Practical Example

A blog can be 100% static and only use JavaScript for:
- a search bar
- a theme toggle
- a mobile menu

Everything else **doesn't need JS**.

## Why is Astro ideal for blogs?


Astro shines especially in content projects:

### Performance

- Pre-rendered HTML
- Zero unnecessary JavaScript
- Excellent Core Web Vitals

### DX (Developer Experience)

- Native MDX support
- Typed Content Collections
- Simple and explicit routing

### Flexibility

- You can use Tailwind, CSS, or both
- Integrate frameworks only when you need to
- Scale without major refactoring

## Astro + MDX

MDX allows you to write content in Markdown and use components simultaneously.

Example:

```mdx
<Card>
<h3>Reusable Content</h3>

<p>This is Markdown + components.</p>
</Card>
