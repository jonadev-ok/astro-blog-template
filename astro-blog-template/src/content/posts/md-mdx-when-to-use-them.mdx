## Markdown First

Markdown is ideal when:

- you only need text
- you want simplicity
- there is no interaction

It's fast, portable, and easy to maintain.

---

## Why MDX?

MDX adds the possibility of:

- using components
- inserting minimal logic
- enriching the content

Without turning the article into an app.

---

## Good Judgment

Using MDX doesn't mean using it all the time.

If the content doesn't need it, Markdown is sufficient.

---

## Conclusion

MDX is a tool, not a requirement. Use it when it provides real value to the reader.
